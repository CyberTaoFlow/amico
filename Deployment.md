# Example of how AMICO could be deployed in a network #

In this example we assume the local network generates about 5Gbps of traffic, as seen from the network edge. We also assume that the network operator owns a traffic visibility switch, which allows for mirroring the network traffic to multiple ports. The "load balancing" of the mirrored traffic could be done on a per-flow base, if the switch has that capability, or by splitting the network into smaller source IP ranges and mirroring the traffic of an entire local subnetwork to a specific mirror port. The ultimate goal is to preserve TCP flow "consistency", whereby all packets belonging to the same TCP flow arrive to the same mirror port.

To allow AMICO to reconstruct and classify all PE files observed in the traffic, in this scenario we could split the traffic over 6 x 1Gbps network cards. This way, we could simply run 6 different `pe_dump` processes, one per each network card. (Notice that even though we assume the traffic volume to be <= 5Gbps we suggest using 6 x 1Gbps cards to allow for some slack in case of traffic peaks).
