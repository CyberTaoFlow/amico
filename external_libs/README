PF_RING installation

See http://www.ntop.org/products/pf_ring/

Here is what worked for us on Debian:

1) Download and untar PF_RING

2) Make sure you have these packages installed

libpcap-dev
bison
flex
byacc

You will also have to install the kernel headers

3) cd PF_RING /userland
4) make

5) cd libpcap
6) make
7) sudo make install

To compile pe_dump with the new pf_ring-aware libpcap, use Makefile.pfring
