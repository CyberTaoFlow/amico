Test pcaps:


- test_pe_noncorrupt_complex_trace_baidu.pcap

Contains a somewhat challenging PE file reconstruction case, 
with many TCP segment reorderings and a data segment arriving 
after the Server's FIN packet. If correctly reconstructed, 
this should produce a PE file with 
MD5 = 6b4f636288c88c25224de302a7231299

- test_pe_corrupt_reset_trace_msecnd_anon.pcap

Contains a case of a PE file download interrupted by a
RST packet sent by the client in the middle of the download
