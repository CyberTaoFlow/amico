Test pcaps:


- test_pe_download_noncorrupt.pcap

Contains a somewhat challenging file reconstruction case, 
with many TCP segment reorderings and a data segment arriving 
after the Server's FIN packet. If correctly reconstructed, 
this should produce a PE file with 
MD5 = 6b4f636288c88c25224de302a7231299
