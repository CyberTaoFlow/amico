# Example: training_start_date = "2014-02-30"
# If left as None, all the download events from the beginning are
# used for training the classifier
# It is recommended to leave atleast 30 days for bootstrapping i.e.
# say you started running AMICO from 2014-01-20, then the training
# start date should be later than 2014-02-20
training_start_date = "2012-08-01"
# If left as None, all the download events till the end are used
# for training the classifier
# training_days = 60
training_days = 2
